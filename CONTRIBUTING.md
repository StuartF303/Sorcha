## AI-Generated Code Requirements

### Overview

Sorcha welcomes the use of AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, ChatGPT, etc.) to enhance developer productivity. However, **all AI-generated code must meet the same quality standards as human-written code**, plus additional documentation requirements.

### Mandatory Documentation Updates

When you use AI tools to generate code, you **MUST** update the following documentation:

1. **README Files**
   - Project README if architecture/features change
   - Component README for new APIs or configuration

2. **Documentation Files** (`docs/`)
   - API reference for new endpoints
   - Architecture docs for new services
   - Development status for completion updates

3. **Spec-Kit Documentation** (`.specify/`)
   - **MASTER-TASKS.md** - Update task status (Required!)
   - Service specifications for API changes
   - Status files for progress tracking

4. **Code Documentation**
   - XML comments for all public APIs
   - OpenAPI documentation for REST endpoints
   - Inline comments for complex logic

### AI Code Checklist

Before submitting a PR with AI-generated code:

- [ ] All required documentation is updated (see policy below)
- [ ] MASTER-TASKS.md reflects task completion
- [ ] OpenAPI/XML documentation is complete
- [ ] README files are current
- [ ] Code passes all tests
- [ ] Manual review of AI-generated code completed

### Complete Policy

See [.specify/AI-CODE-DOCUMENTATION-POLICY.md](.specify/AI-CODE-DOCUMENTATION-POLICY.md) for complete requirements, examples, and workflow.

**Important:** PRs with AI-generated code will not be approved without proper documentation updates.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure README.md and relevant docs are updated (REQUIRED for AI-generated code - see above)
2. **Add Tests**: Include unit tests for new functionality
3. **Update Changelog**: Add entry to CHANGELOG.md if it exists
4. **Follow Style**: Ensure code follows project style guidelines
5. **Pass CI**: All CI checks must pass
6. **Get Review**: At least one maintainer must approve

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code builds without errors or warnings
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and follow guidelines
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Follows coding guidelines

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use xUnit as the testing framework
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests

- Test service interactions
- Use test containers where appropriate
- Clean up resources after tests

### Test Organization

```
tests/
├── Sorcha.Blueprint.Engine.Tests/
