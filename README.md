# Sorcha

A distributed ledger platform for secure, multi-participant data flow orchestration built on .NET 10 and .NET Aspire.

Sorcha implements the **DAD** (Disclosure, Alteration, Destruction) security model - creating cryptographically secured registers where disclosure is managed through defined schemas, alteration is recorded on immutable ledgers, and destruction risk is eliminated through peer network replication.

## Platform Capabilities

Sorcha is a **distributed ledger platform** for building secure, multi-participant workflows — where multiple parties need to exchange, validate, and record structured data with cryptographic guarantees.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Blueprint Workflows** | Define multi-step, multi-party data flows as declarative JSON blueprints with conditional routing, JSON Schema validation, and JSON Logic evaluation |
| **Distributed Ledger** | Immutable, append-only transaction registers with chain validation, Merkle-tree dockets, and DID URI addressing (`did:sorcha:register:{id}/tx:{txId}`) |
| **Cryptographic Wallets** | HD wallet management (BIP32/39/44) with multi-algorithm support — ED25519, NISTP-256, RSA-4096 — for signing, verification, and payload encryption |
| **Portable Execution Engine** | Stateless blueprint engine runs identically on server (.NET) and client (Blazor WASM) for validation, calculation, routing, and selective disclosure |
| **Multi-Tenant Identity** | JWT-based authentication with service-to-service OAuth2 client credentials, delegation tokens, participant identity registry, and wallet address linking |
| **Peer Network** | gRPC-based P2P topology for register replication across nodes with hub/peer architecture and heartbeat monitoring |
| **Consensus & Validation** | Validator service with memory pool, docket building, genesis creation, and transaction integrity verification |
| **Real-Time Notifications** | SignalR hubs with Redis backplane for live action notifications, register events, and workflow state changes |
| **API Gateway** | YARP reverse proxy with aggregated OpenAPI documentation, health check aggregation, and centralized CORS/security policies |
| **AI Integration** | MCP Server for AI assistant interaction (Claude Desktop, etc.) + AI-assisted blueprint design chat via Claude API |

**Security Model — DAD (Disclosure, Alteration, Destruction):**
- **Disclosure**: Field-level encryption and selective data disclosure via JSON Pointers (RFC 6901) ensure participants see only what they're authorized to access
- **Alteration**: Every data change is recorded as a cryptographically signed transaction on an immutable ledger
- **Destruction**: Peer network replication eliminates single-point-of-failure data loss risk

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or later (version 10.0.100+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (required for integration tests and Redis)
- A code editor:
  - [Visual Studio 2025](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (recommended for Windows)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C# extension
  - [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

### Quick Start

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Sorcha now uses **Docker-Compose as the primary development environment**. When you modify service code, you must rebuild the Docker container. See [Docker Development Workflow](docs/DOCKER-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md) for details.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StuartF303/Sorcha.git
   cd Sorcha
   ```

2. **Start all services with Docker Compose** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   **Access the services:**
   - Register Service: http://localhost:5290
   - Validator Service: http://localhost:5100
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:5110
   - Sorcha UI: http://localhost/app
   - Aspire Dashboard: http://localhost:18888

3. **Run walkthrough tests**
   ```bash
   pwsh walkthroughs/RegisterCreationFlow/test-register-creation-docker.ps1
   ```

4. **After making code changes, rebuild the service:**
   ```bash
   # Quick rebuild script
   pwsh scripts/rebuild-service.ps1 <service-name>

   # Or manually:
   docker-compose build <service-name>
   docker-compose up -d --force-recreate <service-name>
   ```

### Running in Development

> **📘 Full Docker Workflow Guide:** [docs/DOCKER-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md](docs/DOCKER-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md)

#### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Active Development)

**Start all services:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f                    # All services
docker logs sorcha-register-service -f    # Specific service
```

**Rebuild after code changes:**
```bash
# Using helper script (recommended)
pwsh scripts/rebuild-service.ps1 register-service

# Or manually
docker-compose build register-service
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate register-service
```

**Stop all services:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

**Why Docker-Compose for development:**
- ✅ Production-like environment
- ✅ Complete service isolation
- ✅ Consistent across team
- ✅ Works with walkthroughs
- ✅ No .NET version conflicts
- ✅ Easy to reset state

#### Option 2: Using .NET Aspire AppHost (For Debugging)

Use AppHost when you need Visual Studio debugging with breakpoints:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Apps/Sorcha.AppHost
```

This will:
- Start all services with .NET process isolation
- Launch the Aspire dashboard at `http://localhost:18888`
- Enable Visual Studio debugger attachment
- Start PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis containers via Docker

**Access Points:**
- **Aspire Dashboard**: `http://localhost:18888`

#### Option 3: Using Docker Compose (Production-Like)

For a production-like environment with all services containerized.

> 📘 **Quick Start Guide**: See [docs/DOCKER-QUICK-START.md](docs/DOCKER-QUICK-START.md) for a comprehensive Docker deployment guide.

**Prerequisites:**
1. **Generate HTTPS Certificate** (required for API Gateway):
   ```bash
   # Create certificates directory
   mkdir -p docker/certs

   # Generate development certificate
   dotnet dev-certs https -ep docker/certs/aspnetapp.pfx -p SorchaDev2025 --trust
   ```

2. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   # Start all services with Docker Compose
   docker-compose up -d

   # View logs
   docker-compose logs -f

   # Stop all services
   docker-compose down
   ```

**Access Points:**
- **API Gateway (HTTP)**: `http://localhost/` - Landing page with system dashboard
- **API Gateway (HTTPS)**: `https://localhost/` - Secure access (requires certificate)
- **API Documentation**: `http://localhost/scalar/` - Interactive Scalar API docs
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost/api/health` - Aggregated service health
- **Dashboard Stats**: `http://localhost/api/dashboard` - Platform statistics (blueprints, wallets, registers)
- **Aspire Dashboard**: `http://localhost:18888` - Observability and telemetry

**Infrastructure Services:**
- **PostgreSQL**: `localhost:5432` - User: `sorcha`, Password: `sorcha_dev_password`
- **MongoDB**: `localhost:27017` - User: `sorcha`, Password: `sorcha_dev_password`
- **Redis**: `localhost:6379` - No authentication

**P2P gRPC Endpoints:**
- **Hub Node**: `localhost:50051` - gRPC P2P hub for external connections
- **Peer Service**: `localhost:50052` - gRPC peer node connections

**Networking:**
- Single bridge network (`sorcha-network`)
- Services communicate via Docker DNS (e.g., `http://wallet-service:8080`)
- External access via published ports only
- Backend services (blueprint, wallet, register, tenant, validator) are not directly exposed
- All HTTP/HTTPS API access goes through the API Gateway
- See [docs/DOCKER-BRIDGE-NETWORKING.md](docs/DOCKER-BRIDGE-NETWORKING.md) for detailed networking architecture

### Development Workflow

1. **Make code changes** in your preferred editor

2. **Run tests** to verify changes
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

3. **Hot reload** - Many changes reload automatically without restart when using `dotnet watch`
   ```bash
   dotnet watch --project src/Services/Sorcha.Blueprint.Service
   ```

4. **Format code** before committing
   ```bash
   dotnet format
   ```

5. **Check for issues**
   ```bash
   # Check for vulnerable packages
   dotnet list package --vulnerable

   # Check for outdated packages
   dotnet list package --outdated
   ```

## Administrative CLI Tool

The Sorcha CLI (`sorcha`) is a cross-platform administrative tool for managing the distributed ledger platform. It provides commands for organization management, wallet operations, transaction handling, register administration, and peer network monitoring.

### Installation

The CLI is packaged as a .NET global tool:

```bash
# Install from local build
dotnet pack src/Apps/Sorcha.Cli
dotnet tool install --global --add-source ./src/Apps/Sorcha.Cli/bin/Release Sorcha.Cli

# Or run directly without installing
dotnet run --project src/Apps/Sorcha.Cli -- [command] [options]
```

### Available Commands

#### Organization Management
```bash
# List organizations
sorcha org list --profile dev

# Get organization details
sorcha org get --org-id acme-corp

# Create new organization
sorcha org create --name "Acme Corporation" --subdomain acme
```

#### User Management
```bash
# List users in organization
sorcha user list --org-id acme-corp

# Get user details
sorcha user get --username admin@acme.com
```

#### Authentication & Session Management
```bash
# Login as a user (interactive - recommended)
sorcha auth login

# Login with explicit credentials (less secure - use interactive mode)
sorcha auth login --username admin@acme.com --password mypassword

# Login as a service principal (interactive)
sorcha auth login --client-id my-app-id

# Login as a service principal (non-interactive)
sorcha auth login --client-id my-app-id --client-secret my-secret

# Check authentication status for current profile
sorcha auth status

# Check authentication status for specific profile
sorcha auth status --profile staging

# Logout from current profile
sorcha auth logout

# Logout from all profiles
sorcha auth logout --all
```

**Authentication Features:**
- **Secure Token Storage**: Tokens are encrypted using platform-specific mechanisms:
  - **Windows**: DPAPI (Data Protection API)
  - **macOS**: Keychain
  - **Linux**: Encrypted storage with user-specific keys
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Access tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire
- **Multi-Profile Support**: Authenticate separately for dev, staging, and production environments
- **Interactive Mode**: Passwords and secrets are masked during input (recommended for security)
- **OAuth2 Support**: Both password grant (users) and client credentials grant (service principals)

**Security Best Practices:**
- Always use interactive mode (`--interactive`) to avoid exposing credentials in process lists
- Never commit credentials to source control
- Use service principals for automated/CI scenarios
- Regularly rotate service principal secrets

#### Wallet Operations
```bash
# List wallets
sorcha wallet list

# Create new wallet
sorcha wallet create --name "My Wallet" --algorithm ED25519

# Get wallet details
sorcha wallet get --address wallet-addr-123

# Sign data
sorcha wallet sign --address wallet-addr-123 --data dGVzdCBkYXRh
```

#### Register & Transaction Management
```bash
# List registers
sorcha register list

# Get register details
sorcha register get --register-id reg-123

# Submit transaction
sorcha tx submit --register-id reg-123 --payload '{"type":"invoice","amount":1500.00}'

# Query transactions
sorcha tx list --register-id reg-123
```

#### Peer Network Monitoring _(Sprint 4 - Stub Implementation)_
```bash
# List all peers in the network
sorcha peer list --status connected

# Get peer details
sorcha peer get --peer-id peer-node-01 --show-metrics

# View network topology
sorcha peer topology --format tree

# Network statistics
sorcha peer stats --window 24h

# Health checks
sorcha peer health --check-connectivity --check-consensus
```

**Note:** Peer commands currently provide stub output. Full gRPC client integration with the Peer Service is planned for a future sprint.

### Global Options

All commands support these global options:

```bash
--profile, -p     # Configuration profile (dev, staging, production) [default: dev]
--output, -o      # Output format (table, json, csv) [default: table]
--quiet, -q       # Suppress non-essential output
--verbose, -v     # Enable verbose logging
```

### Examples

**List organizations in table format (default):**
```bash
sorcha org list --profile dev
```

**Get wallet details in JSON format:**
```bash
sorcha wallet get --address wallet-123 --output json
```

**Submit transaction with complex payload:**
```bash
sorcha tx submit --register-id reg-123 --payload '{
  "type": "invoice",
  "amount": 1500.00,
  "metadata": {
    "invoice_id": "INV-2025-001"
  }
}'
```

### Future: Interactive Mode (REPL)

An interactive console mode is planned for Sprint 5, which will enable:
- Persistent session with authentication
- Context awareness (set current org/register)
- Command history and tab completion
- Multi-line input for complex JSON payloads

See [CLI-SPRINT-4-SUMMARY.md](docs/CLI-SPRINT-4-SUMMARY.md) for full planning details.

**Run all tests:**
```bash
dotnet test
```

**Run specific test project:**
```bash
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.Blueprint.Api.Tests
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.Cryptography.Tests
```

**Run with code coverage:**
```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

**Run tests in watch mode (auto-rerun on changes):**
```bash
dotnet watch test --project tests/Sorcha.Blueprint.Api.Tests
```

**Filter tests by name:**
```bash
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CryptoModule"
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests require Docker for Redis.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Ensure Docker Desktop is running
docker ps

# Run integration tests
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.Gateway.Integration.Tests
```

**What they test:**
- Full Aspire AppHost with all services
- YARP gateway routing
- Service-to-service communication
- Health check aggregation
- Redis caching

### Workflow Demo Tests

The Expense Approval Workflow demonstrates Blueprint functionality with JSON Logic routing:

**Run the workflow demo tests:**
```bash
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.Blueprint.Engine.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ExpenseApprovalWorkflowDemoTests"
```

**What it demonstrates:**
- **JSON Logic Routing**: Dynamic workflow paths based on expense amount:
  - < $100 → Instant system approval
  - $100-$1000 → Route to manager for review
  - ≥ $1000 → Route to finance director for approval
- **Participant Role Fulfillment**: Employee, Manager, Finance Director, and System roles
- **Data Flow Visualization**: CLI output shows the complete approval workflow
- **Workflow Execution**: Real-time routing decisions with formatted console output

**Example output:**
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ Expense Approval - Manager Review ($100-$1000)            ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📝 Expense Claim Submitted:

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Performance Tests

Load test the application using NBomber:

```bash
# Run performance tests (30s duration, 50 RPS target)
dotnet run --project tests/Sorcha.Performance.Tests --configuration Release -- http://localhost:5000 30 50

# Quick test (10s duration, 10 RPS)
dotnet run --project tests/Sorcha.Performance.Tests --configuration Release -- http://localhost:5000 10 10
```

### Cryptography Library Tests

Test the cryptography library with multiple key types:

```bash
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.Cryptography.Tests
```

**Example: Performance testing different key types**
```bash
# Run specific crypto tests
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.Cryptography.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ED25519"
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.Cryptography.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~NISTP256"
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.Cryptography.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~RSA4096"
```

**Benchmarking crypto operations:**
```csharp
// Example: Load test key generation
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
{
    var result = await cryptoModule.GenerateKeySetAsync(WalletNetworks.ED25519);
}

// Example: Load test signing
var keySet = await cryptoModule.GenerateKeySetAsync(WalletNetworks.ED25519);
byte[] hash = SHA256.HashData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("test data"));

for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
{
    await cryptoModule.SignAsync(hash, (byte)WalletNetworks.ED25519, keySet.Value!.PrivateKey.Key!);
}
```

### Code Coverage Reports

Generate HTML coverage reports:

```bash
# Install report generator (one time)
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

  -reports:"**/coverage.cobertura.xml" \
  -targetdir:"coverage-report" \
  -reporttypes:Html

# Open report (Windows)
start coverage-report/index.html

# Open report (Mac/Linux)
open coverage-report/index.html
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

End-to-end browser tests require Playwright setup:

```bash
# First-time setup
cd tests/Sorcha.UI.E2E.Tests
dotnet build
pwsh bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 install --with-deps

# Run E2E tests
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.UI.E2E.Tests

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
dotnet test tests/Sorcha.UI.E2E.Tests -- NUnit.Headless=false
```

### Continuous Testing

Watch tests and auto-run on file changes:

```bash
# Watch all tests
dotnet watch test

# Watch specific project
dotnet watch test --project tests/Sorcha.Cryptography.Tests
```

### Test Best Practices
