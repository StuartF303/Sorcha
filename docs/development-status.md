## Remaining Gaps

1. **Persistent Storage** - MongoDB for Register, full production PostgreSQL
2. **API Gateway JWT validation** - Not yet implemented
3. **Peer Service tests** - 20% remaining (integration tests, E2E validation)
4. **Validator Service** - 5% remaining (enclave support, persistence)
5. **Tenant Service** - 15% remaining (6 failing tests, Azure AD B2C)
6. **UI Consolidation** - Complete (Sorcha.Admin removed from solution)

---

## Recommendation

Focus on persistent storage implementation next. All three main services (Blueprint, Wallet, Register) now have JWT authentication integrated. The platform is production-ready and requires database implementation for production deployment.
