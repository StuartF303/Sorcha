# OpenAPI Documentation Review & Improvement Plan

**Date:** 2025-12-11
**Status:** ✅ Decisions Made - Implementation In Progress
**Target:** Production-Ready API Documentation

**📋 See Also:** [OpenAPI Documentation Decisions](./openapi-documentation-decisions.md) - Answers to all clarification questions

## Executive Summary

The Sorcha platform currently has OpenAPI documentation implemented across all services using .NET 10 built-in OpenAPI and Scalar UI. However, the documentation lacks:
- Comprehensive service introductions
- Real-world examples for endpoints
- Authentication/authorization workflows
- Complete aggregation (missing 3 services)
- Consistent descriptions and metadata

This document outlines the clarifications needed and proposes a systematic improvement plan.

---

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Consistent Technology Stack**
   - All services use .NET 10 built-in OpenAPI (per constitution)
   - Scalar UI deployed (Purple theme, C# examples)
   - Security headers properly configured
   - Integration tests for aggregation

2. **Service Coverage**
   - Blueprint Service: ✓ OpenAPI + Scalar
   - Register Service: ✓ OpenAPI + Scalar
   - Peer Service: ✓ OpenAPI + Scalar
   - Tenant Service: ✓ OpenAPI + Scalar
   - Wallet Service: ✓ OpenAPI (no Scalar)
   - API Gateway: ✓ OpenAPI + Scalar + Aggregation

3. **Documentation Pattern**
   - Endpoints use `.WithName()`, `.WithSummary()`, `.WithDescription()`, `.WithTags()`
   - Minimal APIs with fluent documentation
   - OpenAPI 3.0.1 standard

### ❌ What's Missing/Broken

1. **Aggregation Issues**
   - Only 2 of 5 services aggregated (Blueprint, Peer)
   - Missing: Tenant, Wallet, Register services
   - No unified introduction/overview

2. **Documentation Gaps**
   - No service-level introductions explaining purpose
   - Limited or missing examples on most endpoints
   - No request/response examples
   - No error response documentation
   - No authentication flow documentation

3. **Metadata Issues**
   - Generic/incomplete descriptions
   - Missing operation summaries on some endpoints
   - Inconsistent tag usage
   - No versioning strategy

4. **User Experience**
   - No "Getting Started" guide
   - No workflow documentation (e.g., "How to create and submit a transaction")
   - No authentication examples
   - Scattered documentation across 6+ Scalar UIs

---

## Clarifications Needed

### 1. Service Descriptions & Purpose

**Question:** What should each service's high-level description say?

**Current State:** Generic or missing descriptions

**Needed for Each Service:**

#### Tenant Service
- **Purpose:** ?
- **Primary Use Cases:** ?
- **Key Concepts:** Organizations, Users, Service Principals, RBAC?
- **Target Audience:** Administrators, system integrators?

#### Wallet Service
- **Purpose:** Cryptographic key management for signing transactions?
- **Primary Use Cases:** Create wallets, sign data, manage keys?
- **Key Concepts:** HD wallets, BIP39, ED25519/NISTP256/RSA4096?
- **Security Model:** How are private keys stored/protected?

#### Register Service
- **Purpose:** Distributed ledger for immutable transaction records?
- **Primary Use Cases:** Create registers, query transactions, manage ledgers?
- **Key Concepts:** Registers, transactions, immutability, chain verification?

#### Peer Service
- **Purpose:** P2P network coordination and monitoring?
- **Primary Use Cases:** Network health, peer discovery, gossip protocol?
- **Key Concepts:** Peer nodes, network topology, consensus?

#### Blueprint Service
- **Purpose:** Workflow definition and execution?
- **Primary Use Cases:** Define workflows, execute actions, manage state?
- **Key Concepts:** Blueprints, actions, participants, JSON-LD?

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

**Question:** How should authentication be documented in OpenAPI?

**Current State:** No authentication documentation in OpenAPI specs

**Clarifications Needed:**
- What authentication scheme is used? (OAuth2, Bearer tokens?)
- Where do users get tokens? (`/api/service-auth/token`?)
- What are the required scopes/permissions?
- Should we use OpenAPI security schemes?
- Example token request/response?

**Proposed OpenAPI Security Scheme:**
```yaml
securitySchemes:
  BearerAuth:
    type: http
    scheme: bearer
    bearerFormat: JWT
    description: OAuth2 Bearer token from Tenant Service
```

### 3. Examples Strategy

**Question:** What level of examples should we provide?

**Options:**
1. **Minimal:** Just request schema, no examples
2. **Basic:** One example per endpoint
3. **Comprehensive:** Multiple examples (success, validation errors, auth errors)

**Recommendation:** **Comprehensive** - Include:
- ✓ Successful request/response
- ✓ Validation error (400)
- ✓ Authentication error (401)
- ✓ Authorization error (403)
- ✓ Not found (404)

### 4. Workflow Documentation

**Question:** What workflows should be documented?

**Proposed Workflows:**
1. **Getting Started**
   - Authenticate with service principal
   - Create organization
   - Create first user

2. **Wallet & Transaction Flow**
   - Create wallet
   - Get wallet address
   - Sign transaction data
   - Submit signed transaction to register

3. **Blueprint Execution**
   - Create blueprint from template
   - Add participants
   - Execute blueprint actions
   - Query execution status

4. **Peer Network Monitoring**
   - Check network health
   - View peer statistics
   - Monitor transaction distribution

**Where to Document?**
- In aggregated OpenAPI spec?
- Separate markdown guide?
- Scalar UI introduction section?

### 5. Error Response Standards

**Question:** How should errors be documented?

**Current State:** Inconsistent error responses

**Proposed Standard:**
```json
{
  "type": "https://sorcha.io/errors/validation-error",
  "title": "Validation Error",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "The request contains invalid data",
  "errors": {
    "name": ["The name field is required"],
    "email": ["The email field must be a valid email address"]
  }
}
```

**Should we use RFC 7807 Problem Details?**

### 6. Versioning Strategy

**Question:** How should API versioning be handled?

**Options:**
1. **URL versioning:** `/api/v1/wallets`
2. **Header versioning:** `Accept: application/vnd.sorcha.v1+json`
3. **No versioning:** Breaking changes deploy as new services

**Current State:** No versioning strategy

**Recommendation?**

### 7. Aggregated Documentation Structure

**Question:** How should the aggregated OpenAPI spec be organized?

**Proposed Structure:**
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Sorcha Platform API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    # Sorcha Distributed Ledger Platform

    ## Overview
    Sorcha is a distributed ledger platform...

    ## Architecture
    - **Tenant Service:** Multi-tenant organization management
    - **Wallet Service:** Cryptographic key management
    - **Register Service:** Immutable transaction ledger
    - **Peer Service:** P2P network coordination
    - **Blueprint Service:** Workflow orchestration

    ## Getting Started
    1. Authenticate...
    2. Create organization...
    3. Create wallet...

    ## Common Workflows
    ### Submit a Transaction

    description: Transaction submission and queries (Register Service)
  - name: Peers
    description: Network monitoring (Peer Service)
  - name: Blueprints
    description: Workflow orchestration (Blueprint Service)
```

**Is this the right approach?**

### 8. Code Examples

**Question:** What programming languages should we show examples for?

**Current State:** C# HttpClient only (via Scalar)

**Should We Add:**
- ✓ C# (already configured)
- ? TypeScript/JavaScript
- ? Python
- ? cURL (most common)
- ? Go

**Recommendation?**

### 9. Service-Level Documentation Files

**Question:** Should each service have its own detailed OpenAPI documentation before aggregation?

**Proposed Approach:**
1. **Phase 1:** Enhance each service's local OpenAPI spec
   - Add comprehensive descriptions
   - Add examples to all endpoints
   - Document error responses
   - Add service introduction

2. **Phase 2:** Update aggregation service
   - Add Tenant, Wallet, Register services
   - Merge enhanced specs
   - Add platform-level introduction
   - Add workflow documentation

**Or:** Do aggregation first, then push down to services?

### 10. Deprecation Policy

**Question:** How should deprecated endpoints be marked?

**OpenAPI Approach:**
```yaml
deprecated: true
description: |
  **DEPRECATED:** This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed in v2.0.
  Use `/api/v2/wallets` instead.
```

**Should we establish a deprecation timeline?**
- Mark as deprecated in v1.x
- Remove in v2.0
- Minimum 6-month notice?

## Questions for Product Owner / Architect

### Priority Questions

1. **What is the primary audience for the API documentation?**
   - Internal developers only?
   - External integrators?
   - Public API consumers?

2. **What is the timeline for documentation improvements?**
   - Critical for MVP/MVD release?
   - Post-launch improvement?
   - Ongoing refinement?

3. **What is the acceptable level of detail?**
   - Minimal (just enough to integrate)?
   - Standard (industry best practices)?
   - Comprehensive (enterprise-grade documentation)?

4. **Should we auto-generate client SDKs from OpenAPI specs?**
   - Yes → Need pristine, validated specs
   - No → Specs can be less strict

5. **What is the authentication model for production?**
   - OAuth2 with Tenant Service as auth server?
   - External identity provider (Azure AD, Auth0)?
   - API keys?
   - mTLS?

### Technical Questions

6. **Error response format standard?**
   - RFC 7807 Problem Details?
   - Custom format?
   - Service-specific formats?

7. **Versioning strategy?**
   - URL-based (`/v1/`, `/v2/`)?
   - Header-based?
   - No versioning (deploy breaking changes as new services)?

8. **Example data strategy?**
   - Synthetic/realistic examples?
   - Anonymized production data?
   - Standardized test dataset?

9. **Should OpenAPI specs be version controlled separately?**
   - Generate from code (current approach)?
   - Hand-written YAML files?
   - Hybrid approach?

10. **Performance considerations for aggregation?**
    - Fetch specs on every request (current)?
    - Cache specs with TTL?
    - Pre-build aggregated spec at deployment?

5. Standardize error responses
6. Add Scalar UI to Wallet Service

### Phase 2: Aggregation Enhancement (3-5 days)
1. Add missing services to aggregation
2. Create platform-level introduction
3. Add "Getting Started" guide
4. Document common workflows
5. Implement proper tag organization
6. Add authentication flow documentation

### Phase 3: Standards & Tooling (2-3 days)
1. Document API standards (errors, versioning, deprecation)
2. Create API style guide
3. Add validation/linting for OpenAPI specs
4. Set up CI/CD for documentation deployment
5. Create Postman collection from OpenAPI

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (1-2 days)
1. Test all examples in Scalar UI
