## Design Principle

**There is ONE generic transaction submission endpoint.** All transaction types — genesis, control, action, governance — are structurally the same: they carry a payload, a payload hash, signatures, and metadata. The validator does not care about the semantic type; it validates structure, hashes, signatures, and chain integrity uniformly.

Genesis is not a separate protocol — it is a normal transaction with:
- `BlueprintId = "genesis"`
- `ActionId = "register-creation"`
- `Metadata.Type = "Genesis"`
- System wallet signature (provided by the caller, NOT by the validator)

The validator's job is to **validate**, not to **sign**. Signing is always the caller's responsibility.

## Target Architecture

```
Caller (Register Service / Blueprint Service / UI)
    │
    │  1. Build transaction (TxId, RegisterId, BlueprintId, ActionId, Payload)
    │  2. Compute PayloadHash (SHA-256)
    │  3. Sign with appropriate wallet (user wallet or system wallet)
    │  4. Submit to generic endpoint
    │
    ▼
Validator Service — Single Endpoint
    POST /api/v1/transactions/validate
    │
    │  Request: ValidateTransactionRequest
    │    - TransactionId, RegisterId, BlueprintId, ActionId
    │    - Payload (JsonElement), PayloadHash (hex)
    │    - Signatures[] (base64 PublicKey, SignatureValue, Algorithm)
    │    - CreatedAt, ExpiresAt?, PreviousTransactionId?
    │    - Priority, Metadata
    │
    ▼
Unverified Pool (Redis-backed ITransactionPoolPoller)
    │  Key: {prefix}{registerId}:queue / {prefix}{registerId}:data:{txId}
    │  TTL: configurable expiry
    │
    ▼
ValidationEngineService (BackgroundService)
    │  Polls monitored registers periodically
    │  Creates scoped IValidationEngine per batch
    │
    ▼
Validation Pipeline (6 stages — type-agnostic):
    1. Structure validation (TransactionId, RegisterId, Payload)
    2. Payload hash verification (SHA-256)
    3. Schema validation (if enabled)
    4. Signature verification (if enabled)
    4b. Blueprint conformance (if enabled)
    4c. Governance rights for Control TXs (if enabled, detected by metadata)
    5. Chain validation (PrevTxId continuity, fork detection)
    6. Timing validation (expiry, clock skew)
    │
    ▼
Verified Transaction Queue (IVerifiedTransactionQueue)
    │  Priority-ordered (High=10, Normal=0, Low=-10)
    │
    ▼
DocketBuildTriggerService (BackgroundService)
    │  Hybrid triggers: time threshold OR size threshold
    │  Monitors all registers in IRegisterMonitoringRegistry
    │
    ▼
DocketBuilder.BuildDocketAsync()
    │  1. Dequeue from verified queue
    │  2. Check NeedsGenesisDocket (height == 0)
    │  3. Get previous docket hash
    │  4. Compute Merkle root from transaction hashes
    │  5. Compute docket hash (SHA-256)
    │  6. Sign docket with system wallet
    │
    ▼
Consensus (if multi-validator)
    │  ConsensusEngine.AchieveConsensusAsync()
    │
    ▼
WriteDocketAndTransactionsAsync()
    │  POST /api/registers/{registerId}/dockets
    │  Includes transaction models in docket payload
    │
    ▼
Register Service persists to MongoDB
    │  Docket + Transactions sealed in ledger
    │  Register height updated
```

## Transaction Types

All types use the same `ValidateTransactionRequest` model. The type is distinguished by `BlueprintId`, `ActionId`, and `Metadata`.

### 1. Genesis (Register Creation)

- **Submitted by:** RegisterCreationOrchestrator
- **BlueprintId:** `"genesis"` (`GenesisConstants.BlueprintId`)
- **ActionId:** `"register-creation"` (`GenesisConstants.ActionId`)
- **Signed by:** System wallet (caller obtains system wallet from Wallet Service and signs before submission)
- **Metadata:** `Type=Genesis`, `RegisterName`, `TenantId`, `SystemWalletAddress`
- **Docket:** Genesis docket (number 0) created by GenesisManager when register height == 0
- **Priority:** High

### 2. Blueprint Publish (Control)

- **Submitted by:** Register Service publish endpoint
- **BlueprintId:** Actual blueprint ID (e.g., `"7f3f88d6-1fcc-4231-b3a4-17874540802e"`)
- **ActionId:** `"blueprint-publish"`
- **Signed by:** System wallet (caller signs via Wallet Service)
- **Metadata:** `Type=Control`, `transactionType=BlueprintPublish`, `publishedBy=...`
- **Docket:** Normal docket (number N+1)
- **Priority:** High

### 3. Action (Blueprint Execution)

- **Submitted by:** Blueprint Service
- **BlueprintId:** Blueprint being executed
- **ActionId:** Current action step (string representation of action ID)
- **Signed by:** User's wallet (externally signed before submission)
- **Metadata:** Optional
- **Docket:** Normal docket
- **Priority:** Normal

### 4. Governance (Control)

- **Submitted by:** Register Service governance endpoints
- **BlueprintId:** `"register-governance-v1"`
- **ActionId:** Operation type (e.g., `"add-member"`, `"remove-member"`, `"transfer-ownership"`)
- **Signed by:** Proposer's wallet + quorum signatures
- **Metadata:** `Type=Control`, `transactionType=Control`
- **Priority:** High

## Current State vs Target

### What exists today

| Endpoint | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `POST /api/v1/transactions/validate` | Generic transaction submission | Working (used by Blueprint Service for action TXs) |
| `POST /api/validator/genesis` | Genesis/Control TX submission | Working but WRONG approach |

### Problem: The genesis endpoint signs transactions

The `/api/validator/genesis` endpoint currently:
1. Accepts unsigned transactions from callers
2. **Signs them with the system wallet internally**
3. Constructs the `Transaction` object with genesis defaults
4. Submits to the unverified pool

This violates the separation of concerns. The validator should **validate**, not **sign**. The signing responsibility belongs to the caller.

### Problem: Two different request models

- `ValidateTransactionRequest` — used by generic endpoint (BlueprintId, ActionId, Payload, Signatures required)
- `GenesisTransactionRequest` — used by genesis endpoint (ControlRecordPayload, optional overrides, NO required signatures)

These should be ONE model. A genesis transaction is structurally identical to any other transaction.

### Problem: Blueprint publish uses the genesis endpoint

The Register Service publish endpoint (`/api/registers/{registerId}/blueprints/publish`) currently submits via `SubmitGenesisTransactionAsync()` which hits `/api/validator/genesis`. This is wrong — blueprint publish is not genesis. It should submit to the generic endpoint like any other transaction.

---

## Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Move signing to callers

1. **RegisterCreationOrchestrator** — Already has `IWalletServiceClient`. After constructing the genesis transaction, call `walletClient.SignTransactionAsync()` with the system wallet to produce a signature. Then submit the fully-signed transaction to the generic `/api/v1/transactions/validate` endpoint using `SubmitTransactionAsync()`.

2. **Register Service publish endpoint** — Inject `IWalletServiceClient`. Sign the blueprint publish transaction with the system wallet before submission. Use `SubmitTransactionAsync()` instead of `SubmitGenesisTransactionAsync()`.

3. **Governance endpoints** — Already have user wallet signatures from the proposer. Submit via `SubmitTransactionAsync()`.

### Phase 2: Update the generic endpoint

The generic `/api/v1/transactions/validate` endpoint already accepts all required fields. No changes needed to the request model — `ValidateTransactionRequest` already has:
- `TransactionId`, `RegisterId`, `BlueprintId`, `ActionId`
- `Payload` (JsonElement), `PayloadHash`
- `Signatures[]` (base64 PublicKey, SignatureValue, Algorithm)
- `CreatedAt`, `ExpiresAt?`, `PreviousTransactionId?`
- `Priority`, `Metadata`

The only potential change: ensure the validation pipeline handles transactions with `BlueprintId = "genesis"` without rejection (structure validation, blueprint conformance, etc.)

### Phase 3: Deprecate the genesis endpoint

Once all callers use the generic endpoint:
1. Mark `/api/validator/genesis` as deprecated
2. Eventually remove it
3. Remove `GenesisTransactionSubmission`, `GenesisTransactionRequest` models
4. Remove `SubmitGenesisTransactionAsync()` from `IValidatorServiceClient`

### Phase 4: Ensure validation pipeline is type-agnostic

The ValidationEngine should handle all transaction types uniformly:
- **Signature verification**: Same for all types — verify provided signatures against payload
- **Blueprint conformance**: Skip for genesis/control (BlueprintId = "genesis" or metadata Type = "Control")
- **Chain validation**: Same for all types — check PrevTxId continuity
- **Schema validation**: Skip for genesis/control (no schema defined)

## Known Issues

### Issue 1: Validator Stuck in Initialization Loop

**Symptom:** Validator logs show repeated `RegisterServiceClient initialized` / `WalletServiceClient initialized` messages every ~10 seconds with no actual transaction processing.

**Possible causes:**
- No registers in the `IRegisterMonitoringRegistry` (nothing to monitor)
- Service client initialization failing and retrying
- Background services not starting properly

**Investigation needed:**
- Check if `monitoringRegistry.RegisterForMonitoring()` was called after genesis
- Check if `ValidationEngineService` and `DocketBuildTriggerService` are running
- Verify Redis connectivity for the transaction pool

### Issue 2: Stale Direct-Write Transaction

**Symptom:** A blueprint publish transaction was previously stored directly to MongoDB via `transactionManager.StoreTransactionAsync()` without going through the validator. This transaction:
- Exists in the ledger without a docket
- Has no system wallet signature
- Was never validated

**Impact:** The register now has an orphan transaction that doesn't belong to any docket. The chain integrity may be broken.

**Resolution options:**
1. Delete the orphan transaction from MongoDB manually
2. Leave it — the docket builder only processes transactions from the verified queue
3. The WriteDocket endpoint handles duplicate transactions gracefully (DuplicateKey catch)

### Issue 3: WriteDocket Endpoint Authorization

**Concern:** The `/api/registers/{registerId}/dockets` POST endpoint requires `CanWriteDockets` authorization policy. The validator service must authenticate with the register service to write dockets.

**Check:** Verify the validator's service-to-service JWT includes the required claims for `CanWriteDockets`.

### Issue 4: Genesis Signature Verification

**Concern:** The genesis endpoint currently skips signature verification in `ValidationEngine.VerifySignaturesAsync()` for transactions with `BlueprintId = "genesis"`. When we move signing to callers and use the generic endpoint, we need to ensure:
- The generic endpoint validates genesis signatures normally
- The ValidationEngine doesn't skip signature checks for genesis BlueprintId
- The signing data format matches what `VerifySignaturesAsync` expects: `SHA-256("{TxId}:{PayloadHash}")`

### Issue 5: System Wallet Availability

**Concern:** When signing moves to the caller (Register Service), the Register Service needs access to the system wallet. Currently:
- RegisterCreationOrchestrator already has `IWalletServiceClient` and calls `CreateOrRetrieveSystemWalletAsync`
- The genesis endpoint has retry/recreate logic for unavailable wallets
- This wallet management logic needs to be available to all callers that submit system-signed transactions

**Recommendation:** Create a `ISystemWalletSigningService` in `Sorcha.ServiceClients` that encapsulates:
1. Getting/creating the system wallet address
2. Signing data with the system wallet
3. Retry/recreate on wallet unavailability

## Action Items

### Immediate (P0)

1. **Refactor blueprint publish** to use `SubmitTransactionAsync()` (generic endpoint) instead of `SubmitGenesisTransactionAsync()` (genesis endpoint). Register Service publish endpoint needs to sign with system wallet before submission.

2. **Refactor RegisterCreationOrchestrator** to use `SubmitTransactionAsync()` instead of `SubmitGenesisTransactionAsync()`. It already has `IWalletServiceClient` — just needs to sign the genesis transaction before submission.

3. **Create ISystemWalletSigningService** to encapsulate system wallet acquisition, signing, and retry logic. Used by both the orchestrator and publish endpoint.

4. **Investigate validator initialization loop** — Determine why validator only logs initialization messages and never processes transactions.

5. **Clean up orphan transaction** — Remove the directly-stored transaction from MongoDB.

### Short-term (P1)

6. **Deprecate genesis endpoint** — Once all callers use the generic endpoint, mark the genesis endpoint as deprecated.

7. **Audit ValidationEngine for type-specific logic** — Ensure the pipeline doesn't have hard-coded BlueprintId checks that would reject genesis/control transactions submitted via the generic endpoint.

8. **Wire governance endpoints** through the generic submission path.

9. **Audit all transaction write paths** — Ensure NO path writes to the register without going through the validator. Known paths to check:
   - ~~Blueprint publish endpoint~~ (FIXED — uses validator, but still via genesis endpoint)
   - Governance endpoints
   - Any diagnostic/admin endpoints
   - The WriteDocket endpoint's transaction insertion (OK — validator calls it)

### Long-term (P2)

10. **Remove genesis endpoint** and all associated models (`GenesisTransactionSubmission`, `GenesisTransactionRequest`, `SubmitGenesisTransactionAsync`).

11. **Unify service client** — Only `SubmitTransactionAsync()` on `IValidatorServiceClient`, using `ActionTransactionSubmission` (rename to `TransactionSubmission`).
