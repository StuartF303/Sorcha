# Sorcha Peer Service - Executive Summary

## Overview

The Sorcha Peer Service is a proposed peer-to-peer (P2P) networking component that will enable decentralized transaction distribution across a network of Sorcha nodes. This document provides a high-level summary of the design, implementation plan, and business value.

**Document Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-01-04
**Status:** Awaiting Approval

## Business Value

### Problem Statement

Currently, Sorcha operates as a centralized platform where all transactions must flow through a single Engine instance. This creates:

- **Single Point of Failure**: If the Engine goes down, the entire network stops
- **Scalability Bottleneck**: All traffic must go through one server
- **Geographic Limitations**: High latency for users far from the central server
- **Privacy Concerns**: All transactions visible to central authority
- **Offline Operation**: No ability to work when disconnected from central server

### Proposed Solution

The Peer Service transforms Sorcha into a **decentralized peer-to-peer network** where:

- ✅ Each node can operate independently
- ✅ Transactions distribute automatically across all peers
- ✅ No single point of failure
- ✅ Automatic failover and recovery
- ✅ Offline-first operation with automatic sync
- ✅ Direct peer-to-peer communication for privacy

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description | Business Impact |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Decentralization** | No single point of failure | 99.9%+ uptime, reduced hosting costs |
| **Scalability** | Distributed load across all peers | Support 10x more transactions |
| **Resilience** | Automatic failover and recovery | Zero downtime deployments |
| **Geographic Distribution** | Deploy peers globally | <100ms latency worldwide |
| **Bandwidth Efficiency** | Gossip protocol minimizes traffic | 90% reduction in bandwidth costs |
| **Offline Operation** | Work disconnected, auto-sync when online | Mobile/field deployment enabled |
| **Privacy** | Direct P2P communication | Enterprise compliance requirements |

```

### Core Components

1. **Peer Discovery Service**
   - Automatically finds and connects to other peers
   - Uses bootstrap nodes (e.g., peer.sorcha.org)
   - Maintains list of healthy peers
   - Runs every 15 minutes (configurable)

2. **Communication Manager**
   - Tries gRPC streaming first (best performance)
   - Falls back to gRPC request/response
   - Falls back to REST API if gRPC unavailable
   - Ensures all peers can communicate

3. **Transaction Distribution**
   - Uses "Gossip Protocol" for efficient distribution
   - Each peer tells a few neighbors
   - Neighbors repeat to their neighbors
   - Result: 90% of network knows in <1 minute

4. **Network Address Discovery**
   - Detects external IP address
   - Handles NAT firewalls (using STUN protocol)
   - Works behind corporate firewalls
   - Configurable manual override

5. **Offline/Online Mode**
   - Queues transactions when offline
   - Automatically syncs when back online
   - No data loss during network outages

### Communication Protocols

**Primary:** gRPC with streaming (high performance, low latency)
**Fallback 1:** gRPC request/response (compatible, good performance)
**Fallback 2:** REST API (universal compatibility)

All protocols use the same data format, ensuring interoperability.

### Gossip Protocol Efficiency

**Traditional Approach:**
- Send transaction to ALL peers (N messages)
- Network saturates quickly
- Bandwidth: O(N²)

**Gossip Approach:**
- Send to sqrt(N) random peers
- They repeat to their sqrt(N) peers
- Bandwidth: O(N log N)
- **Result: 90% reduction in network traffic**

**Example:**
- 100 peers: 10 messages per round vs 100
- 1000 peers: 30 messages per round vs 1000
- **Savings: 97% bandwidth reduction at scale**

## Implementation Plan

### Timeline

**Total Duration:** 20 weeks (5 months)
**Team Size:** 2-3 developers
**Sprints:** 10 two-week sprints

### Sprint Breakdown
