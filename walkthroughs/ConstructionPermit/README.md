# Construction Permit Approval

**Purpose:** Multi-org, multi-user workflow demonstrating conditional routing, calculations, and verifiable credential issuance across four organizations
**Date Created:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop, PowerShell 7+, Sorcha services running

---

## Overview

This walkthrough demonstrates a realistic construction permit approval process involving four organizations and five participants. A contractor submits building plans, which pass through structural assessment, planning review, optional environmental review (conditional on risk score), building control inspection, and final council approval — producing a **Building Permit Verifiable Credential** at the end.

The scenario exercises every major Sorcha capability:
- **Multi-organization participation** — 4 separate orgs with independent wallets
- **Multi-user within one org** — Council has both a Planning Officer and Building Control Inspector
- **Conditional routing** — high-risk projects go through environmental review, low-risk skip it
- **Calculations** — risk score computed from building parameters, permit fee from project value
- **Rejection paths** — Planning Officer can reject back to contractor
- **Verifiable credential issuance** — approved permits produce a signed VC

---

## Scenario

### The Story

**Meridian Construction** wants to build a new development on a brownfield site. They submit their plans through Sorcha, which routes the application through structural assessment, council planning, an optional environmental review (for high-risk builds), building control sign-off, and finally back to the council planning officer for permit issuance.

Two test runs demonstrate the branching:
1. **Low risk** — 3-storey residential (risk score 5.5) skips environmental review
2. **High risk** — 8-storey commercial (risk score 14.5) triggers environmental review

### Organizations

| Organization | Role | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Meridian Construction** | Contractor | Submits building application with plans and site data |
| **Apex Structural Engineers** | Structural Assessor | Independent review of structural integrity, calculates risk score |
| **Riverside Borough Council** | Local Authority | Two participants: Planning Officer (zoning + final approval) and Building Control Inspector (technical sign-off) |
| **Green Valley Environmental** | Environmental Assessor | Conducts impact assessment when risk score is high (conditional) |

### Participants

| Participant ID | Display Name | Organization | Role in Workflow |
|---|---|---|---|
| `contractor` | Site Manager | Meridian Construction | Submits application (Action 1) |
| `structural-engineer` | Lead Engineer | Apex Structural Engineers | Structural assessment + risk calculation (Action 2) |
| `planning-officer` | Planning Officer | Riverside Borough Council | Zoning review + final approval (Actions 3, 6) |
| `environmental-assessor` | Environmental Consultant | Green Valley Environmental | Environmental impact assessment (Action 4, conditional) |
| `building-control` | Building Control Inspector | Riverside Borough Council | Technical inspection + fee calculation (Action 5) |

        { "==": [{ "var": "buildingType" }, "commercial"] }, 1.2,
        1.0
      ]}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Risk score examples:**
| Scenario | Storeys | Floor Area | Type | Formula | Risk Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `zoningCompliant` | boolean | Whether the project complies with local zoning regulations |
| `planningNotes` | string | Planning officer's assessment notes |

**Routing (conditional):**
- If `riskScore >= 7` → Route to **Action 4** (Environmental Assessment)
- If `riskScore < 7` → Route to **Action 5** (Building Control Inspection)

**Rejection:** Can reject back to Action 1 (contractor must resubmit)

**Disclosures:**
- `planning-officer` sees all accumulated data
- `environmental-assessor` sees: projectName, siteAddress, buildingType, grossFloorArea, riskScore, structuralGrade (if routed to action 4)

---

#### Action 4: Environmental Impact Assessment (Conditional)
**Participant:** `environmental-assessor` (Green Valley Environmental)

        { "*": [{ "var": "grossFloorArea" }, 1.50] }
      ]}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Fee examples:**
| Project Value | Floor Area | Fee Formula | Permit Fee |

**Credential Issuance:**
On approval, a **Building Permit Verifiable Credential** is minted:

```json
{
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "BuildingPermitCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:sorcha:w:{planning-officer-wallet}",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "permitNumber": "RBC-2026-00142",

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Where |
|---|---|
| Template parameterisation | Participant wallet addresses injected at instance creation |
| Conditional routing | Action 3 branches on riskScore (>= 7 or < 7) |
| Rejection routing | Actions 3, 4, 6 can reject back to Action 1 |
| Chained calculations | Risk score (Action 2) feeds routing; permit fee (Action 5) feeds credential |
| Selective disclosure | Each participant sees only what they need |
| Multi-user same org | Planning Officer and Building Control are both Riverside Council |
| Verifiable credential | Building Permit VC issued on final approval |
| Credential downstream use | Contractor can present the permit VC to other systems/inspectors |
