This walkthrough is design-only (planning phase).
It has not been updated to use the shared SorchaWalkthrough module.
The scripts and documentation here represent an early design study
for user and wallet creation flows.

For working wallet creation examples, see:
- walkthroughs/WalletVerification/ (wallet creation + signing)
- walkthroughs/PingPong/ (wallet creation as part of participant setup)
