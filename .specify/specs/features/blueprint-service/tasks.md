## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundational) → Phase 3-8 (Features) → Phase 9 (Polish)
```

### Feature Dependencies

- **Phase 3 (US2 - Action Execution)**: Core flow - MUST complete first
- **Phase 4 (Rejection)**: Independent after US2
- **Phase 5-7 (US3-5)**: Integrate with US2, can run in parallel
- **Phase 8 (Parallel Branches)**: Independent after US2

### Parallel Opportunities

Phase 2 (all [P] tasks):
```
T006, T007, T008, T009, T010, T011, T012, T013
```

After Phase 3:
```
Phase 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 can run in parallel
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First

1. Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T014)
3. Phase 3: US2 Action Execution (T015-T023)
4. **VALIDATE**: Full orchestration works → **MVP!**

### Incremental Delivery

1. MVP + Phase 4 (Rejection) → Error handling
2. + Phases 5-7 → Validation, routing, disclosures
3. + Phase 8 → Parallel branches
4. + Phase 9 → Polish

---

## Notes

- Existing service is 95% complete - these tasks add orchestration
- StateReconstructionService is the key new component
- Delegation token required for all action execution
- Parallel branches can defer if not MVP-critical
- Test coverage target: >85%
