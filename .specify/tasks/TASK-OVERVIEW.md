# Siccar.Cryptography Rewrite - Task Overview

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-12
**Status:** Planning Phase

## Summary

This document provides an overview of all tasks required to complete the Siccar.Cryptography library rewrite. The rewrite will transform the existing SiccarPlatformCryptography into a clean, standalone, reusable cryptography library.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Cryptographic bugs in core operations | Critical | Low | Test vectors, security audit, peer review | Dev Team |
| Performance regression vs old library | High | Medium | Benchmarks, profiling, optimization | Dev Team |
| Breaking changes affect SICCAR services | High | Medium | Compatibility layer, phased migration | Architecture |
| Incomplete test coverage | Medium | Medium | Coverage enforcement, TDD approach | QA |
| Security vulnerabilities discovered | Critical | Low | Security audit, external review | Security |

## Quality Gates

Each phase must meet these criteria before proceeding:

### Phase 1-2 Gates
- [ ] All code compiles without warnings
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Code coverage >80%
- [ ] No critical static analysis issues

### Phase 3-4 Gates
- [ ] Code coverage >90%
- [ ] All test vectors passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Security tests passing

### Phase 5-6 Gates
- [ ] All documentation complete
- [ ] NuGet package builds successfully
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No regressions in SICCAR platform
- [ ] Security audit approved

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality:** >90% test coverage, zero critical bugs
- **Performance:** Meets or exceeds targets in spec NFR-2
- **Security:** Passes security audit and timing attack tests
- **Usability:** Successfully integrated in SICCARV3 with no breaking changes
- **Documentation:** Complete API docs and migration guide
- **Adoption:** NuGet package published and used by external project (goal)

## Resources

- **Developers:** 1-2 developers (estimated)
- **Timeline:** 10 weeks (estimated)
- **Budget:** Internal development time
- **External Review:** Security audit (recommended)

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this task breakdown
2. Assign TASK-001 to developer
3. Set up project tracking in Azure DevOps or GitHub Projects
4. Schedule weekly progress reviews
5. Begin Phase 1 implementation
