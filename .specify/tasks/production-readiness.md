- ✅ Health checks configured for all infrastructure services
- ✅ Comprehensive infrastructure setup guide created (`docs/INFRASTRUCTURE-SETUP.md`)
- ✅ Data persistence with Docker volumes
- ⚠️ **Note:** Windows/Docker Desktop may require `host.docker.internal` for host connectivity

### AUTH-004 Status Details

✅ **Complete (2025-12-12)** - Automatic database seeding implemented
- ✅ DatabaseInitializer enhanced with service principal seeding
- ✅ Default organization created: "Sorcha Local" (subdomain: `sorcha-local`)
- ✅ Default admin user: `admin@sorcha.local` / `Dev_Pass_2025!`
- ✅ Service principals created: Blueprint, Wallet, Register, Peer services
- ✅ Well-known GUIDs for consistent testing
- ✅ Client secrets generated and logged on first startup
- ✅ Configurable via appsettings ("Seed:*" configuration keys)
- ✅ Documentation added to scripts/README.md
- ⚠️ **Action Required:** Copy service principal secrets from Tenant Service logs on first startup

## First-Run Setup & Commissioning (P0 - BLOCKER)

| ID | Task | Priority | Effort | Status | Assignee |
|----|------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| SETUP-001 | First-run setup wizard/script for fresh installations | P0 | 24h | 📋 Not Started | - |

### SETUP-001 Problem Statement

**Issue:** On a totally clean build or fresh Docker Desktop installation, numerous key service resources are missing, causing startup failures:

- Docker volumes for key storage (wallets, certificates)
- File caches and data directories
- `.env` files with deployment-specific configuration
- Database initialization (schemas, seed data)
- Redis configuration and initial state

**Impact:** New developers or fresh deployments cannot start the system without manual intervention and tribal knowledge.

### SETUP-001 Requirements

The solution must provide an interactive setup process that:

1. **Environment Detection:**
   - Detect if this is a first-run (missing volumes, .env, databases)
   - Check Docker Desktop availability and version
   - Verify required ports are available (80, 5432, 6379, 27017, etc.)

2. **Configuration Generation:**
   - Prompt for deployment-specific values (organization name, admin email, domains)
   - Generate `.env` file with secure defaults
   - Generate `appsettings.Local.json` overrides
   - Create service-specific configuration files

3. **Infrastructure Provisioning:**
   - Create required Docker volumes (`sorcha-postgres-data`, `sorcha-redis-data`, `sorcha-mongo-data`, `sorcha-wallet-keys`)
   - Create required directories (`./data/caches`, `./data/logs`, `./data/uploads`)
   - Set appropriate permissions

4. **Database Initialization:**
   - Run database migrations for all services
   - Seed initial data (organizations, admin user, service principals)
   - Verify database connectivity

5. **Validation:**
   - Health check all infrastructure services
   - Verify service-to-service connectivity
   - Generate setup report with credentials and next steps

### SETUP-001 Deliverables

- [ ] `scripts/setup.ps1` - PowerShell setup wizard (Windows)
- [ ] `scripts/setup.sh` - Bash setup script (Linux/macOS)
- [ ] `scripts/setup-config.yaml` - Configuration template with defaults
- [ ] `scripts/validate-environment.ps1` - Environment validation script
- [ ] `docs/FIRST-RUN-SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- [ ] Update `docker-compose.yml` to fail gracefully with helpful messages if not commissioned
- [ ] Add pre-flight check to AppHost that detects missing resources

### SETUP-001 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fresh clone + `docker-compose up` shows clear message to run setup first
- [ ] Setup script runs interactively with sensible defaults
- [ ] Setup script can run non-interactively with config file for CI/CD
- [ ] All services start successfully after setup completes
- [ ] Setup can be re-run safely (idempotent)
- [ ] Clear documentation for both developers and operators
