# Archive: Pre-Unified Plan (2025-11-16)

**Archive Date:** 2025-11-16
**Reason:** Superseded by unified MASTER-PLAN.md and MASTER-TASKS.md
**Status:** Historical Reference Only

---

## Archived Documents

This archive contains planning documents that have been consolidated into the new unified master plan.

### Archived Files

1. **plan.md** (v2.0)
   - Previous implementation plan
   - Superseded by: [MASTER-PLAN.md](../../MASTER-PLAN.md)
   - Reason: Multiple overlapping plans caused confusion

2. **IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md**
   - Wallet service implementation summary from 2025-11-13
   - Superseded by: MASTER-PLAN.md Phase 2 and MASTER-TASKS.md Phase 2
   - Reason: Consolidated into unified task tracking

3. **BLUEPRINT-SERVICE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** (v2.1)
   - Detailed 138-task blueprint service plan
   - Superseded by: MASTER-PLAN.md Phase 1 and MASTER-TASKS.md Phase 1
   - Reason: Merged into master task list with updated priorities

4. **WALLET-PROGRESS.md**
   - Wallet service progress tracking
   - Superseded by: MASTER-TASKS.md Phase 2
   - Reason: Consolidated into unified progress tracking

## Why These Were Archived

**Problem:** Multiple planning documents with overlapping information created confusion:
- Different completion percentages in different documents
- Unclear prioritization across initiatives
- Difficult to understand critical path for MVD
- Redundant task tracking

**Solution:** Created unified planning structure:
- **MASTER-PLAN.md** - Single source of truth for implementation strategy
- **MASTER-TASKS.md** - Consolidated task list with clear priorities
- Clear MVD (Minimum Viable Deliverable) definition
- Single progress tracking system

## What Changed

### Unified Structure
- **Before:** plan.md, BLUEPRINT-SERVICE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md, WALLET-PROGRESS.md
- **After:** MASTER-PLAN.md + MASTER-TASKS.md

### Clearer Priorities
- **Before:** All tasks treated as equally important
- **After:** P0 (MVD Blocker), P1 (MVD Core), P2 (Nice-to-Have), P3 (Post-MVD)

### MVD Focus
- **Before:** All features planned with equal weight
- **After:** Clear MVD definition with 12-week timeline

### Consolidated Phases
- **Phase 1:** Blueprint-Action Service (Weeks 1-6)
- **Phase 2:** Wallet Service API (Weeks 7-9)
- **Phase 3:** Register Service MVD (Weeks 10-12)
- **Phase 4+:** Post-MVD enhancements

## Using These Archives

**For Historical Reference:**
- These documents provide context on how the plan evolved
- Useful for understanding previous architectural decisions
- May contain details not carried forward to new plan

**For Active Development:**
- **DO NOT** use these documents for current work
- **ALWAYS** refer to MASTER-PLAN.md and MASTER-TASKS.md
- **UPDATE** only the master documents

## Timeline

**2025-11-11:** Initial constitution and spec created
**2025-11-13:** Wallet service specification and tasks created
**2025-11-15:** Blueprint service unified design completed
**2025-11-16:** Master plan consolidation (this archive created)
