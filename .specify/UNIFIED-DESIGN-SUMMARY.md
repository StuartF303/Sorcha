# Unified Blueprint-Action Service - Design Summary

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Status:** Approved for Implementation
**Author:** Sorcha Architecture Team

---

## Executive Summary

The Sorcha Blueprint Service has been redesigned as a **unified service** that combines blueprint management with action execution capabilities. The centerpiece of this redesign is a **portable Blueprint Execution Engine** that can run both client-side (in Blazor WASM) and server-side (in the Blueprint Service) for validation and verification.

This design **supersedes and merges** the previously separate:
- Blueprint Service (90% complete)
- Action Service (fully designed, not implemented)

---

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. New Portable Execution Engine (`Sorcha.Blueprint.Engine`)

**What Changed:**
- **Before:** Blueprint.Engine was planned as a REST API service
- **After:** Blueprint.Engine is now a **standalone class library** with zero ASP.NET dependencies

**Why:**
- Enables client-side validation in Blazor WASM
- Allows users to test blueprints before publishing
- Provides instant feedback without server round-trip
- Same validation logic runs client-side and server-side (no discrepancies)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stateless** - No internal state, all context passed as parameters
- **Portable** - Runs in browser (WASM) and server (.NET)
- **Zero External Dependencies** - Only JSON processing libraries
- **Pure Functions** - Deterministic results for same inputs
- **Highly Testable** - Easy to unit test in isolation

**Capabilities:**
- JSON Schema validation (Draft 2020-12)
- JSON Logic evaluation for calculations and conditions
- Selective disclosure processing using JSON Pointers
- Routing determination based on conditions
- Complete action processing orchestration

---

### 2. Unified Blueprint-Action Service

**What Changed:**
- **Before:** Separate Blueprint Service (CRUD) and Action Service (execution)
- **After:** Single unified service combining both capabilities

**Why:**
- Reduces operational complexity (fewer services to deploy/manage)
- Better cohesion (blueprint and action operations are tightly related)
- Shared caching and state management
- Simplified service discovery and integration

**New Responsibilities:**
1. **Blueprint Management** (existing)
   - CRUD operations
   - Publishing and versioning
   - Validation

2. **Action Operations** (new)
   - Action retrieval (starting actions, pending actions)
   - Action submission
   - Action rejection
   - File handling

3. **Execution Coordination** (new)
   - Uses portable execution engine
   - Payload encryption/decryption (via Wallet Service)
   - Transaction building and submission (via Register Service)

4. **Real-Time Notifications** (new)
   - SignalR hub for action updates
   - Redis backplane for scale-out
   - WebSocket support

---

### 3. Blueprint Designer Integration

**What Changed:**
- **Before:** Designer only created and viewed blueprints
- **After:** Designer can validate and test blueprints using execution engine

**New Capabilities:**
- Client-side validation using portable execution engine
- Real-time validation as users enter data
- Blueprint "Test Mode" to simulate execution
- Shows calculation results, routing decisions, and disclosure filtering
- No server round-trip needed for validation

---

## Blueprint Execution Flow

### Client-Side (Blazor WASM)

```
User enters action data
    ↓
Blazor component uses IExecutionEngine (WASM)
    ↓
Validates against schema
    ↓
Applies calculations
    ↓
Shows preview of results
    ↓
User confirms and submits
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant feedback (<100ms)
- Works offline
- Reduces server load
- Better user experience

### Server-Side (Blueprint Service)

```
Action submission received
    ↓
Service uses IExecutionEngine (Server)
    ↓
Validates against schema
    ↓
Applies calculations
    ↓
Determines routing
    ↓
Creates disclosures
    ↓
Encrypts payloads (Wallet Service)
    ↓
Builds transaction
    ↓
Submits to Register Service
    ↓
Notifies participants (SignalR)
```

**Benefits:**
- Authoritative validation
- Integration with external services
- Transaction coordination
- Audit logging

- `POST /api/actions/reject` - Reject action

### Execution Helpers (NEW - for client-side)
- `POST /api/execution/validate` - Validate action data only
- `POST /api/execution/calculate` - Apply calculations only
- `POST /api/execution/route` - Determine routing only
- `POST /api/execution/disclose` - Apply disclosure rules

### File Operations (NEW)
- `GET /api/files/{wallet}/{register}/{tx}/{fileId}` - Download file

### SignalR Hub (NEW)
- `/actionshub` - Real-time notifications
  - `ActionAvailable(notification)` - New action available
  - `ActionConfirmed(notification)` - Action confirmed
  - `ActionRejected(notification)` - Action rejected

1. **Single execution logic** - Same code runs client and server
2. **Better testing** - Portable engine is easy to unit test
3. **Faster development** - Reuse logic across client and server
4. **Type safety** - Strong typing throughout

### For Users
1. **Instant validation** - No server round-trip needed
2. **Offline testing** - Test blueprints in browser
3. **Better UX** - Immediate feedback on data entry
4. **Transparency** - See exactly what will happen before submitting

### For Operations

## Migration from Separate Services

**No migration needed** - The Action Service was never implemented.

**Blueprint Service Updates:**
- Existing endpoints remain unchanged
- New endpoints added for action operations
- Execution engine reference added
- SignalR hub added

**Breaking Changes:**
- None - This is a new design, not a redesign of existing functionality

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why make the engine portable instead of a service?**
A: Client-side validation provides instant feedback without server round-trip, enabling a better user experience and offline testing capabilities.

**Q: Why merge Blueprint and Action services?**
A: They are tightly related and share state. A single service reduces operational complexity and improves cohesion.

**Q: Will this work with large payloads?**
A: Yes, the engine is stateless and processes data in memory. For very large payloads (>10MB), streaming can be added.

**Q: How does caching work?**
A: Redis caching at the service layer (blueprints, actions). The engine itself is stateless and doesn't cache.

**Q: How does the engine handle errors?**
A: Validation errors are returned in the result object. Runtime errors throw exceptions.

**Q: Can the engine be extended with custom logic?**
A: Yes, JSON Logic supports custom operators. The engine can be extended via dependency injection.
