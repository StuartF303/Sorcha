## P0 — Transaction Pipeline Audit

> **Priority:** P0 (MVD Blocker)
> **Status:** 🚧 In Progress
> **Research Doc:** [docs/transaction-submission-flow.md](../docs/transaction-submission-flow.md)

All transactions MUST go through the Validator Service mempool before being sealed into dockets. Direct writes to the register ledger are NOT permitted. This task audits the entire transaction submission pipeline to ensure correctness.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Document current transaction submission flows (genesis, action, control, governance) | ✅ |
| 2 | Ensure blueprint publish submits through validator, not directly to register | ✅ |
| 3 | Investigate validator initialization loop (no transaction processing observed) | 📋 |
| 4 | Test end-to-end: publish blueprint → validator mempool → validation → docket → register | ✅ (ping-pong 40/40 actions, canonical JSON hashing fix) |
| 5 | Audit all register write paths for direct-store bypasses | ✅ (see 036 research R3) |
| 6 | Wire governance operations through validator pipeline | 📋 |
| 7 | Clean up orphan transaction from prior direct-write (MongoDB) | 📋 |
| 8 | ~~Consider dedicated `/api/validator/control` endpoint vs reusing genesis~~ | ✅ Resolved: legacy genesis endpoint removed, all types use generic `POST /api/v1/transactions/validate` |

## Recent Updates

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| 2026-02-21 | **038-Content-Type-Payload** (69 tasks, 9 phases): Content-Type Aware Payload Encoding. Added `ContentType` and `ContentEncoding` metadata fields to `PayloadModel`/`PayloadInfo`. Created `PayloadEncodingService` (Base64url/identity/Brotli/Gzip, 4KB compression threshold). Migrated ~128 call sites from legacy Base64 to Base64url (RFC 4648 §5). MongoDB BSON Binary storage: `MongoTransactionDocument` with `Base64UrlBinarySerializer`/`BinaryAwareStringSerializer` for dual-format reads (~33% storage reduction). `JsonTransactionSerializer` emits native JSON for identity-encoded payloads. 81+ new tests. Deferred: PayloadManager compression integration (T059), Blueprint/Validator wire-format identity encoding (T053/T054/T060/T061). |
| 2026-02-21 | **Organization Admin UI Upgrades** — 4 phases: (1) Fixed transaction type display — `TransactionViewModel.TransactionType` now uses `MetadataTransactionType` enum (0=Control, 1=Action, 2=Docket, 3=Participant) instead of falling through to "Transfer" for Participant TXs. Updated chip colors in TransactionRow/TransactionDetail. (2) Restructured `/admin/organizations` from flat list→user-list into tabbed `OrganizationDashboard` with Overview, Users, Participants, Published, Configuration tabs. Dual auth: system admins see org list, org admins auto-load their org via `org_id` claim. (3) Added `OrganizationConfiguration` tab with security policy stubs, external IdP placeholder, and branding editor (saves via existing API). (4) Full participant publishing UI: `IParticipantPublishingService` (publish/update/revoke via Tenant Service API), 3-step `PublishParticipantDialog` wizard (select register → review addresses → confirm+sign), "Publish" button on ParticipantList and ParticipantDetail, `PublishedParticipantsList` tab querying Register Service. Tests: 16 new (11 TransactionViewModel, 5 PublishingService). |
| 2026-02-21 | **Transaction Architecture Critical Review** — 10 research items (TRUST-1 to TRUST-10) added to [deferred-tasks.md](tasks/deferred-tasks.md). Critical analysis of transaction core: how transactions are built, signed, validated, sealed into dockets, and disclosed. Identified structural trust gaps: (1) Validator doesn't re-execute calculations — accepts whatever Blueprint Engine submits (TRUST-1). (2) Disclosure rules enforced at app layer, not cryptographically verified by Validator (TRUST-2). (3) No signed transaction receipts proving finality (TRUST-3). (4) Merkle inclusion proofs not generateable for lightweight offline verification (TRUST-4). (5) No first-class revocation/amendment transaction type (TRUST-5). (6) Consensus has no deterministic finality — simple >51% quorum (TRUST-6). (7) No cross-register cryptographic references (TRUST-7). (8) Transaction lifecycle audit trail discarded on persistence (TRUST-8). (9) Timestamps self-asserted, no authority (TRUST-9). (10) No key rotation/re-encryption for compromised keys (TRUST-10). Tier 1 priority: TRUST-1,2,3,4 (closes active trust gaps without architectural upheaval). |
| 2026-02-21 | **Medical Equipment Refurb Walkthrough** — All 3 scenarios PASS (12/12 steps, 266s). Scenario A: routine refurb (4 actions, riskCategory=routine, cost=2000, VC issued). Scenario B: safety-critical (5 actions, riskCategory=safety-critical, cost=7000, regulatory review, VC issued). Scenario C: rejection (3 actions, BER at quote stage). First walkthrough exercising participant publishing (spec 001), multi-org (3 orgs, 4 participants), conditional routing, calculations, rejection paths, and Refurbishment Certificate VC issuance. |
| 2026-02-20 | **001-Participant-Records** (50 tasks, 8 phases): Added `TransactionType.Participant = 3` for publishing participant identity records as transactions on a register. Phase 1: Shared models (ParticipantRecord, ParticipantRecordStatus, participant-record-v1.json schema). Phase 2: Validator accepts Participant TXs with lighter rules (schema validation, no governance check, no blueprint conformance). Phase 3: Tenant Service publishes participant records (deterministic TxId, canonical JSON, wallet signing, validator pipeline). Phase 4: Register Service indexes addresses in-memory (ConcurrentDictionary), query endpoints (list, by-address, by-id), service client methods. Phase 5-6: Update and revoke via new version publishing with PrevTxId chaining. Phase 7: Public key resolution with 410 Gone for revoked. Phase 8: MongoDB index on TransactionType, optional Redis cache write-through, wallet address uniqueness check (409 Conflict), documentation. Tests: 64 new tests (20 index, 12 service client, 32 publishing). |
| 2026-02-19 | **New Submission Flow Bugfixes** — Five bugs fixed in the end-to-end New Submission workflow: (1) **Form not rendering** — `Action.Form` defaults to non-null empty Layout in `Action.cs`; `Action.Form ?? AutoGenerateForm()` always took left side. Fix: check `Elements is { Count: > 0 }` before using explicit form. (2) **Empty instance ID** — API returns `"id"` but `WorkflowInstanceViewModel.InstanceId` had no `[JsonPropertyName]`. Fix: added `[JsonPropertyName("id")]`. (3) **State deserialization crash** — `state` field is numeric enum (0=Active), mapped to string `Status` via `[JsonPropertyName("state")]` caused `JsonException`. Fix: removed mapping, let `Status` default to `"active"`. (4) **403 Forbidden on execute** — `ValidateWalletOwnershipAsync` hard-failed when Participant Service returned 404 (no profile). Fix: graceful degradation — log warning and allow through when participant system is unavailable/unconfigured. (5) **Response deserialization crash** — `NextActionInfo.ActionId` was `string` but server returns `int`; property names mismatched. Fix: aligned `NextActionInfo` to match `NextActionResponse` (int ActionId, ActionTitle, ParticipantId). E2E test added: `NewSubmissionFormTests.cs` (4 Playwright tests). |
| 2026-02-19 | **Genesis TX Signature Fix** — Genesis docket now contains 1 transaction (was 0). Root cause: `RegisterCreationOrchestrator` included attestation signatures in `TransactionSubmission.Signatures`, but the Validator verifies all transaction-level signatures against `SHA256("{TxId}:{PayloadHash}")` — attestation sigs were signed against different data (SHA256 of canonical attestation JSON). Fix: only include system wallet signature at transaction level; attestation sigs remain embedded in the control record payload where they were already verified during `FinalizeAsync`. Also replaced hardcoded `"genesis"` with `GenesisConstants.BlueprintId`. Full register creation walkthrough passes: auth → wallet → initiate → sign attestations → finalize → genesis TX → validator accepts → docket with 1 TX → register height 1. |
| 2026-02-19 | **Construction Permit Walkthrough — ALL 3 SCENARIOS PASS** (11/11 steps, 14/14 actions). Four fixes: (1) PS1 `$actionSenderMap` Int64/Int32 type mismatch — `ConvertFrom-Json` returns Int64 for JSON integers but hashtable keys are Int32; fixed with `[int]` cast. (2) Calculation-before-routing reorder — calculations (e.g. `riskScore`) must be applied BEFORE route condition evaluation so JSON Logic conditions can reference them. (3) `Instance.AccumulatedData` fallback — Register Service doesn't support instance-based transaction queries (always 404), so accumulated payload+calculations are now persisted on the Instance object for cross-action state reconstruction. (4) Blueprint template disclosure fix — Action 4 environmental-assessor needed `/*` disclosure so sender's own submitted data is included in transaction (otherwise Validator rejects with VAL_SCHEMA_004). Scenario A: 5/5 low-risk residential (skips env review). Scenario B: 6/6 high-risk commercial (conditional routing to env review). Scenario C: 3/3 rejection at planning review. |
| 2026-02-19 | **Deterministic Canonical JSON Hashing** — Fixed payload hash verification (TX_012, VAL_HASH_001) across HTTP and Redis boundaries. Root cause: `System.Text.Json` default encoder escapes `+` to `\u002B` in DateTimeOffset/base64, and `GetRawText()` preserves transport encoding not canonical form. Fix: added `CanonicalJsonOptions` (compact, `UnsafeRelaxedJsonEscaping`) to Blueprint Service transaction builder, Validator Core `TransactionValidator`, and `ValidationEngine`. Both producer and verifier now re-canonicalize via `Serialize(payload, CanonicalJsonOptions)` before hashing. Ping-pong walkthrough: 20/20 rounds, 40/40 actions PASS. |
| 2026-02-18 | **037-New-Submission-Page** (31 tasks, 8 phases): Redesigned MyWorkflows.razor from workflow instance list to service directory grouped by register. Created WalletPreferenceService (localStorage-backed smart default), WalletSelector.razor, NewSubmissionDialog.razor (create instance + execute Action 0). Added GetAvailableBlueprintsAsync, CreateInstanceAsync, SubmitActionExecuteAsync (with X-Delegation-Token). Fixed Pending Actions: wired wallet into ActionForm, actual SubmitActionAsync call after dialog. Swapped nav order. Tests: 10 WalletPreferenceService tests pass, UI Core 0w/0e, Web Client 0w/0e. |
| 2026-02-18 | **036-Unified-Transaction-Submission** (26 tasks, 7 phases): Created ISystemWalletSigningService (singleton, whitelist, rate limit, audit logging), unified all transaction types through `POST /api/v1/transactions/validate`, migrated register creation + blueprint publish from legacy genesis endpoint, removed legacy genesis endpoint + models + client methods, renamed ActionTransactionSubmission → TransactionSubmission. Tests: ServiceClients 24 pass, Validator 627 pass (1 pre-existing fail), Register Service 9 pass (2 pre-existing), Blueprint Service 28 pass. |
| 2026-02-18 | P0 Transaction Pipeline Audit: documented full transaction lifecycle, fixed blueprint publish to submit through validator mempool (not direct store), extended genesis endpoint for Control transaction overrides. Changed TrackingData from SortedList to Dictionary for Blazor WASM compatibility. |
| 2026-02-17 | Architecture Validation improvements: genesis TX signature skip (attestation sigs use different contract), docket build log noise fix (WARNING→DEBUG for empty queue), blueprint cache TTL removal (immutable after publish). Added Register instance query endpoint to Phase 3 backlog. |
| 2026-02-17 | Architecture Validation: 8 pipeline fixes (signature contract, blueprint cache, schema extraction, default disclosure, wallet link idempotency, LastTransactionId fallback, PreviousTransactionId field, cyclic idempotency). 3-round ping-pong walkthrough PASS. |

**2026-02-14:**
- ✅ VALIDATOR-PIPELINE-FIX: Validator Pipeline Rewire + Blueprint Conformance Enforcement
  - Rewired disconnected validation pipeline: single path Ingestion → Unverified Pool → ValidationEngine → Verified Queue → DocketBuilder
  - Removed bypass `TransactionPoolPollerService` that fed unvalidated transactions to mempool
  - `ValidationEndpoints` + genesis endpoint now submit to `ITransactionPoolPoller` (unverified pool) instead of `IMemPoolManager`
  - `DocketBuilder` + `ValidatorOrchestrator` now read from `IVerifiedTransactionQueue` instead of `IMemPoolManager`
  - `DocketBuildTriggerService` uses verified queue counts + unverified pool cleanup
  - New `ValidateBlueprintConformanceAsync` in `ValidationEngine`: starting action validation (VAL_BP_001), sender authorization via wallet derivation (VAL_BP_002), action sequencing via routes (VAL_BP_003)
  - Genesis/control transactions bypass schema and blueprint conformance checks
  - `EnableBlueprintConformance` config toggle (default: true)
  - Consensus voter hardening: `ValidateAndVoteAsync` uses full `IValidationEngine` with fallback to structural validation

  - `RedisStreamEventSubscriber`: implements `IEventSubscriber` using `XREADGROUP` consumer groups, `XACK`, pending reclaim
  - `EventSubscriptionHostedService`: BackgroundService driving the subscriber processing loop
  - `InMemoryEventSubscriber`: test-friendly subscriber paired with updated `InMemoryEventPublisher` for dispatch
  - `RegisterEventBridgeService`: BackgroundService bridging 6 domain event topics to SignalR hub notifications
  - Added `RegisterStatusChangedEvent` to Register.Core; `RegisterManager.UpdateRegisterStatusAsync` publishes it
  - Decoupled SignalR: removed direct `IHubContext` calls from endpoints and `RegisterCreationOrchestrator`

  - Created `IReadOnlyRegisterRepository` interface (read-only subset of `IRegisterRepository`)
  - `IRegisterRepository` now extends `IReadOnlyRegisterRepository` (no breaking changes for Register Service)
  - `GovernanceRosterService` constructor changed to accept `IReadOnlyRegisterRepository` (compile-time safety)
  - Added `AddReadOnlyMongoRegisterStorage()` extension method — registers only `IReadOnlyRegisterRepository`
  - Validator Service DI switched from `AddMongoRegisterStorage` to `AddReadOnlyMongoRegisterStorage` — `IRegisterRepository` is NOT resolvable

  - **QW9**: JWT `ValidAlgorithms` restricted to HS256 in JwtAuthenticationExtensions
  - **QW10**: Bootstrap one-shot — `SystemConfiguration` entity + EF migration; BootstrapEndpoints returns 409 Conflict on re-bootstrap
  - **T1**: Org-scoped blueprint authorization — `OrganizationId` on Blueprint model, `ClaimExtensions` helper, org filtering in IBlueprintStore/BlueprintService, all CRUD endpoints extract `org_id` from claims
  - **T2**: SignalR wallet ownership validation — `IParticipantServiceClient` injected into ActionsHub, `ValidateWalletOwnershipAsync` checks linked wallets, fail-closed on service errors, service tokens bypass
  - **T3**: Post-sign transaction signature verification — `GetWalletAsync` + `VerifySignatureAsync` after signing, before Register submission
  - **T4**: Client secrets hashed with Argon2id via BouncyCastle — backward-compatible (32-byte = legacy SHA256, 48-byte = Argon2id salt+hash)
  - **T5**: Per-user login rate limiting — `ITokenRevocationService` wired into Login endpoint, 429 on brute force, reset on success
  - **T8**: Replay attack protection — idempotency key methods on `IActionStore`, auto-generated from request content, 24-hour TTL, 409 Conflict on duplicate
  - **T10**: Register chain validation — PrevTxId format validation (64 chars), chain continuity check, fork detection in `TransactionManager`
  - **T11**: Shell injection eliminated — `ArgumentList` instead of string interpolation in `MacOsKeychainEncryption`, regex-validated keyId in `LinuxSecretServiceEncryptionProvider`
  - **T13**: `IDisposable` on `KeyRing`, `SymmetricCiphertext`, `IEncryptionProvider`; DEK cache 30-min TTL with `Array.Clear` on eviction; `Dispose()` on all encryption providers
  - Updated 3 crypto tests (AES-CBC roundtrip → deprecation assertion tests)
  - Files changed: 31 (27 modified, 4 new); 1375 insertions, 179 deletions

  - BUG FIX: `AuthenticatedHttpMessageHandler` 401 handler now attempts refresh even when initial token was null
  - Added `CloneRequestAsync` helper — `HttpRequestMessage` can't be resent, retry creates fresh request
  - New `TokenRefreshService` with timer-based proactive refresh (fires 5 min before expiry)
  - New `tokenLifecycle.js` — tab visibility change detection triggers immediate token check
  - Server-side logout call (best-effort POST to `/api/auth/logout` before clearing cache)

## Priority Definitions

**P0 - Critical (MVD Blocker):**
Tasks that must be completed for the MVD to function. Without these, the end-to-end workflow will not work.

**P1 - High (MVD Core):**
Important tasks that significantly enhance the MVD but have workarounds if delayed.

**P2 - Medium (MVD Nice-to-Have):**
Tasks that improve quality, performance, or developer experience but aren't essential for MVD launch.

**P3 - Low (Post-MVD):**
Enhancement tasks that can be deferred until after MVD is complete.
