# AI-Generated Code Documentation Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-11-17
**Status:** Active
**Related:** [constitution.md](constitution.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

---

## Purpose

This policy establishes mandatory documentation requirements for all automated and AI-generated code contributions to the Sorcha project. The goal is to maintain comprehensive, up-to-date documentation that accurately reflects the current state of the codebase.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- AI-assisted code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, ChatGPT)
- Automated code scaffolding and generation tools
- Code templates and generators
- Any code not written entirely by human developers

## Core Principle

**When code is automatically generated, documentation must be automatically updated.**

No AI-generated code contribution is considered complete until all relevant documentation has been reviewed and updated to reflect the changes.

---

## Documentation Update Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Code
When AI generates code, document the following:
- What was generated
- Why it was generated (which task/requirement)
- Any assumptions made
- Any deviations from original specifications

### Step 2: Identify Affected Documentation
Review the checklist above and identify which documentation files need updates.

### Step 3: Update Documentation
For each identified document:
1. Read the current content
2. Identify sections that need updates
3. Make precise, accurate updates
4. Ensure consistency with other documentation
5. Verify examples and code snippets still work

### Step 4: Verify Documentation
Before committing:
- [ ] All links work correctly
- [ ] Code examples compile/run
- [ ] Version numbers are updated
- [ ] Dates are current
- [ ] Status indicators are accurate
- [ ] Cross-references are consistent

### Step 5: Commit Documentation with Code
- Documentation updates should be included in the same PR as code changes
- Commit message should mention documentation updates
- PR description should list documentation files updated

---

## AI-Specific Requirements

### For AI Coding Assistants (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.)

When an AI assistant generates code, it MUST:

1. **Identify Documentation Impact**
   - Analyze which documentation files are affected
   - List them explicitly before making changes

2. **Update Documentation Proactively**
   - Don't wait to be asked
   - Update documentation as part of the code generation task
   - Treat documentation updates as mandatory, not optional

3. **Verify Accuracy**
   - Ensure documentation accurately reflects the generated code
   - Update examples to match new APIs
   - Verify technical details are correct

4. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Keep terminology consistent across all docs
   - Update cross-references
   - Maintain the project's documentation style

5. **Flag Incomplete Documentation**
   - If documentation cannot be fully updated, create a TODO
   - Document what needs to be completed
   - Assign to appropriate owner

### For Human Developers Using AI Tools

When using AI tools to generate code, you are responsible for:

1. **Reviewing AI-Generated Documentation**
   - Don't blindly accept AI documentation updates
   - Verify technical accuracy
   - Ensure it matches project style

2. **Completing Documentation**
   - If AI didn't update all required docs, you must complete them
   - Don't merge PRs with incomplete documentation

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Ensure documentation is helpful to other developers
   - Verify examples work as shown
   - Check that architecture diagrams are updated if needed

## Questions and Support

**Q: What if I'm not sure which documentation to update?**
A: When in doubt, ask in the PR or create a draft PR. Reviewers will help identify required updates.

**Q: Can AI tools automatically update all required documentation?**
A: AI tools can help, but human review is always required. Developers are responsible for accuracy.

**Q: What if the documentation contradicts the code?**
A: The code is the source of truth. Update documentation to match code, and investigate why they diverged.

**Q: How detailed should documentation updates be?**
A: Detailed enough for a new team member to understand the change without reading all the code.
