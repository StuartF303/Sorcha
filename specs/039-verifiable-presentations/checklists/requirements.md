# Specification Quality Checklist: Verifiable Credential Lifecycle & Presentations

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 30 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance scenarios across 8 user stories
- 8 edge cases documented covering status list capacity, network failures, concurrent access, and offline scenarios
- 10 measurable success criteria defined, all technology-agnostic
- 10 assumptions documented covering existing system foundations and external dependencies
- Design document at `docs/plans/2026-02-21-verifiable-credentials-design.md` provides implementation context (separate from spec)
- Spec references W3C standards (Bitstring Status List v1.0, DID Core, OID4VP) as domain requirements, not implementation choices
