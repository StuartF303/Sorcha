# Feature Specification: Hardware Cryptographic Storage and Execution Enclaves

**Feature Branch**: `001-hardware-crypto-enclaves`
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "hardware cryptographic storage and execution enclaves should be used in all but developer environments. We should be able to interface to different cloud providers secure storage like AWS KMS, Azure KeyVault etc as well as local execution environments such as Kubernetes, Docker Desktop or direct Windows / OSx / Linux OS or browser Crypto Storage."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-23

- Q: When multiple cryptographic backends are simultaneously available (e.g., Kubernetes cluster running on Azure with both Azure Key Vault and Kubernetes Secrets accessible), which backend should the system prioritize? → A: Cloud HSM takes precedence (Azure Key Vault/AWS KMS/GCP KMS over Kubernetes Secrets when both available)
- Q: How should key rotation be triggered? → A: Automatic time-based rotation with manual override (system rotates keys automatically based on configured intervals, admins can trigger immediate rotation)
- Q: What authentication mechanism should the system use for accessing cryptographic operations? → A: Managed identities for cloud (Azure Managed Identity/AWS IAM Roles), service accounts for Kubernetes, process identity for local
- Q: At what scope should HSM fallback to software signing be configured? → A: Per-deployment configuration in environment settings (operators configure fallback policy once per environment: enabled/disabled, affects all operations uniformly)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Cloud Production Deployment with Hardware Security (Priority: P1)

An operations team deploys Sorcha to Azure production environment. The system automatically detects Azure environment and provisions cryptographic keys in Azure Key Vault with Hardware Security Module (HSM) backing. All wallet private keys are stored exclusively in the HSM, never exposed to application memory. Transaction signing operations execute within the secure enclave boundary.

**Why this priority**: Production security is the highest priority requirement. Without secure key storage, the entire platform's cryptographic security model is compromised. This is the primary use case for any production deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying to Azure, creating a wallet, signing a transaction, and verifying through Azure Key Vault audit logs that keys were never exported and all cryptographic operations occurred within HSM. Delivers production-grade security for wallet operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Sorcha is deployed to Azure with Key Vault configured, **When** a new wallet is created, **Then** the private key is generated and stored in Azure Key Vault HSM and never appears in application logs or memory dumps
2. **Given** a wallet exists in Azure Key Vault, **When** a transaction is signed, **Then** the signing operation executes within the Key Vault HSM boundary and the private key is never retrieved to application memory
3. **Given** Azure Key Vault is temporarily unavailable, **When** a signing operation is attempted, **Then** the system fails gracefully with a clear error message and queues the operation for retry
4. **Given** wallet operations are executing, **When** Azure Key Vault audit logs are reviewed, **Then** all cryptographic operations are recorded with appropriate access policies enforced

---

### User Story 2 - Multi-Cloud Provider Support (Priority: P1)

A global enterprise uses AWS infrastructure. Their operations team deploys Sorcha to AWS and configures it to use AWS KMS for cryptographic operations. The system seamlessly integrates with AWS KMS HSM, storing wallet keys and executing signing operations within AWS secure enclaves. The same application code works identically on Azure, AWS, or GCP without modification.

**Why this priority**: Multi-cloud support is essential for enterprise adoption. Organizations have existing cloud investments and cannot be locked into a single provider. This is a P1 requirement because it's a common blocking concern in enterprise sales/adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying identical Sorcha configuration to AWS, creating wallets, signing transactions, and verifying through AWS CloudTrail that all key operations occurred within KMS. Swap configuration to Azure and verify identical behavior with different provider. Delivers cloud-agnostic security.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Sorcha is deployed to AWS with KMS configured, **When** a wallet is created, **Then** keys are stored in AWS KMS with HSM backing and all operations are logged in CloudTrail
2. **Given** the same application binary, **When** deployed to Azure vs AWS vs GCP, **Then** the system automatically detects the environment and uses the appropriate provider's HSM service without code changes
3. **Given** a wallet stored in AWS KMS, **When** migrating to Azure Key Vault, **Then** the system provides a secure key export/import mechanism that maintains HSM-to-HSM transfer without exposing keys
4. **Given** multiple cloud providers configured, **When** selecting a storage backend for a new wallet, **Then** users can specify which provider to use while maintaining consistent security guarantees

---

### User Story 3 - Local Development Environment with Software Fallback (Priority: P2)

A developer sets up Sorcha on their local Windows workstation using Docker Desktop. Since no cloud HSM is available and this is a development environment, the system automatically falls back to OS-level cryptographic storage (Windows DPAPI). Keys are still encrypted and protected by the OS, but don't require cloud connectivity. Development workflows proceed normally with reduced security appropriate for local testing.

**Why this priority**: Developer productivity is critical, but local development doesn't require production-grade HSM security. P2 priority because it's essential for team velocity but doesn't block production deployments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running Sorcha locally without cloud credentials, creating wallets, signing transactions, and verifying keys are stored using Windows DPAPI (inspectable via certutil or registry). Delivers frictionless local development while maintaining reasonable key protection.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Sorcha is running on a developer's local machine without cloud provider credentials, **When** a wallet is created, **Then** keys are stored using OS-native secure storage (Windows DPAPI / macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service)
2. **Given** local development mode, **When** the application starts, **Then** a clear warning indicates this is not production-grade security and should only be used for development
3. **Given** a wallet created in local development mode, **When** attempting to deploy to production, **Then** the system prevents migration of development keys to production and requires new key generation in production HSM
4. **Given** Docker Desktop environment, **When** creating a wallet, **Then** keys are stored in the container's secure storage with appropriate volume mounting for persistence

---

### User Story 4 - Kubernetes Production Deployment with Secret Management (Priority: P2)

A DevOps team deploys Sorcha to a Kubernetes cluster. The system integrates with Kubernetes Secrets and external secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, sealed-secrets). Wallet keys are stored as encrypted Kubernetes secrets with optional external KMS encryption. Pod security policies prevent key exposure through container introspection.

**Why this priority**: Kubernetes is a common production deployment target, but can leverage cloud HSM when available. This is P2 because it's important for cloud-native deployments but can delegate to underlying cloud provider HSM (covered in P1).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deploying to a Kubernetes cluster, creating wallets stored as encrypted secrets, verifying pod security contexts prevent key access, and optionally configuring external KMS for envelope encryption. Delivers cloud-native secret management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Sorcha is deployed to Kubernetes, **When** a wallet is created, **Then** the private key is stored as an encrypted Kubernetes Secret with appropriate RBAC policies
2. **Given** Kubernetes cluster with external KMS integration (e.g., cloud provider encryption), **When** wallet secrets are stored, **Then** envelope encryption is used with KEK stored in cloud HSM
3. **Given** a running pod with wallet access, **When** attempting to exec into the pod, **Then** security policies prevent reading raw secret values from the container filesystem
4. **Given** Kubernetes secret rotation policies, **When** KEK rotation occurs, **Then** wallet secrets are transparently re-encrypted without service disruption

---

### User Story 5 - Browser-Based Wallet with Web Crypto API (Priority: P3)

An end-user accesses the Sorcha Blueprint Designer web interface. For client-side signing scenarios, the browser-based application uses the Web Crypto API to generate and store keys in the browser's secure storage (IndexedDB with encryption). Keys are bound to the origin and protected by browser security policies. This enables client-side transaction signing for improved privacy.

**Why this priority**: Browser-based crypto enables client-side signing and improved privacy, but is less critical than server-side production security. P3 because it's a nice-to-have for specific use cases but not required for core platform operation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using the Blueprint Designer in a browser, generating a client-side wallet, signing a transaction, and verifying the private key never leaves the browser (network tab shows only signed transactions, not keys). Delivers client-side signing capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the Blueprint Designer in a web browser, **When** they create a client-side wallet, **Then** keys are generated using Web Crypto API and stored in browser secure storage (non-extractable)
2. **Given** a browser-based wallet, **When** signing a transaction, **Then** the signing operation executes entirely in the browser and only the signed transaction is transmitted to the server
3. **Given** browser-based wallet storage, **When** the user clears browser data, **Then** they are warned that wallet keys will be lost and must be backed up (exported) first
4. **Given** Web Crypto API limitations, **When** attempting to create a browser wallet, **Then** the system clearly indicates browser-specific constraints (e.g., no BIP39 mnemonic export) and suitability for low-value testing only

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a cloud provider's HSM is temporarily unavailable during critical signing operations?**
  - System maintains an operation queue with exponential backoff retry
  - Clear error messages with estimated retry times
  - Fallback to software signing is configurable per-deployment in environment settings (operators decide at deployment time whether fallback is enabled or disabled)
  - When fallback is enabled, all operations use software signing during HSM outage with prominent warnings and comprehensive audit logging
  - Production environments typically configure fallback as disabled (fail-closed approach), while staging/testing environments may enable it for resilience testing

- **How does the system handle migrating keys between providers (e.g., AWS KMS to Azure Key Vault)?**
  - Secure HSM-to-HSM transfer using provider-specific export/import mechanisms
  - Keys remain encrypted during transfer using asymmetric wrapping
  - Audit trail records the migration with cryptographic proof of integrity
  - Migration requires explicit administrative approval

- **What happens when running in an environment where no secure storage is available (e.g., minimal Linux without Secret Service)?**
  - System refuses to start in production mode
  - Development mode allows plaintext storage with prominent warnings and audit logs
  - Configuration requires explicit acknowledgment of security implications

- **How does the system prevent accidental exposure of keys through logging, error messages, or diagnostics?**
  - All key material is marked as sensitive and automatically redacted from logs
  - Error messages never include key data, only key identifiers/handles
  - Memory dumps exclude key material through secure memory allocation
  - Diagnostic endpoints require authentication and omit sensitive data

- **What happens when OS-level secure storage (DPAPI, Keychain) is corrupted or unavailable?**
  - System detects corruption during startup health checks
  - Clear error messages guide user to recovery procedures
  - Backup key export mechanism (encrypted with user password) enables recovery
  - Development environments may allow re-initialization with data loss warning

- **How does the system handle key rotation and versioning?**
  - Each key has a version identifier and creation timestamp
  - Old key versions remain accessible for signature verification
  - New signatures use current key version
  - Rotation occurs automatically based on configured time intervals (e.g., 90-day rotation in production)
  - Administrators can trigger immediate manual rotation (e.g., for security incidents or suspected compromise)
  - Rotation policies are configurable per environment

## Assumptions

- **Cloud Provider Availability**: Production environments are assumed to have reliable connectivity to cloud provider HSM services with published SLA guarantees (typically 99.9%+)
- **Managed Identity Configuration**: Cloud deployments are assumed to have managed identities (Azure Managed Identity, AWS IAM Roles) properly configured with appropriate permissions to access HSM services; Kubernetes deployments have service accounts configured with necessary RBAC permissions
- **Environment Detection**: The system can reliably detect deployment environment through standard environment variables and metadata services (e.g., Azure IMDS, AWS IMDS, Kubernetes downward API)
- **Provider SDK Maturity**: Azure Key Vault SDK, AWS KMS SDK, and GCP Cloud KMS SDK are stable and support required operations (key generation, signing, encryption) with HSM backing
- **Development Environment**: Developers have local OS instances with secure storage capabilities (Windows 10+, macOS 10.12+, Linux with gnome-keyring or similar)
- **Browser Support**: Web Crypto API is available in all supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - all modern versions)
- **Kubernetes Version**: Kubernetes deployments use version 1.20+ with support for encrypted secrets and external KMS integration
- **Security Clearance**: Production HSM usage implies appropriate access controls and compliance requirements are already established by the organization
- **Performance Impact**: HSM operations introduce acceptable latency (<500ms for signing operations) compared to local cryptographic operations
- **Cost Model**: Organizations deploying to production accept cloud provider HSM costs as part of security requirements
- **Key Backup**: For non-HSM scenarios (development), users are responsible for backing up key material; HSM-backed keys are non-exportable by design

## Dependencies

- **Sorcha.Cryptography Library**: Must support abstraction layer for multiple cryptographic backends
- **Sorcha.Wallet.Service**: Requires integration with cryptographic backend selection and configuration
- **Cloud Provider SDKs**: Azure.Security.KeyVault, AWS SDK for .NET (AWSSDK.KeyManagementService), Google.Cloud.Kms.V1
- **Identity and Authentication SDKs**: Azure.Identity (for Managed Identity), AWS SDK credential providers (for IAM Roles), Kubernetes client-go (for service account tokens)
- **OS Cryptographic APIs**: Windows DPAPI (via .NET ProtectedData), macOS Security Framework (via P/Invoke or native interop), Linux Secret Service (via DBus or library)
- **Web Crypto API**: Browser standard (no external dependency, but requires HTTPS context)
- **Kubernetes Client**: For Kubernetes secret integration (KubernetesClient or official client-go bindings)
- **Configuration System**: .NET Configuration framework with environment-specific settings
- **Audit Logging**: Integration with provider-specific audit systems (Azure Monitor, AWS CloudTrail, GCP Cloud Logging)
